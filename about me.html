<p>My name is Angelique Andrade and I will be enrolling as an incoming junior at Jose Marti 
    STEM Academy. I have been part of the junior varsity tennis team for three years. I am 
    very passionate about Tennis because it is an enjoyable sport. Throughout my academic journey,
     Iâ€™ve acquired a wide range of skills, including cooperating with peers, listening, and 
     understanding the ideas of others. I have been involved in various extracurricular activities 
     such as the JMSA student council. I am highly motivated and thrive in challenging environments,
      which is why I am constantly pushing myself to go above and beyond both in and out of the 
      classroom. In addition to my academic and extracurricular pursuits, I enjoy baking, reading 
      and even crocheting which helps me relieve stress and stay focused. Ultimately, my goal is to 
      be a traveling sonographer.I am excited to see where this journey takes me, and I look forward 
      to connecting and collaborating with the RWC program.</p>
